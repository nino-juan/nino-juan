# Juan Nino

🎓 I'm a PhD student at Laval University in Canada (I come from Mexico with a background in mechatronics engineering 🦾🧑‍🛠️). I started my carrer by tackling (manufacturing🏭) industry challenges, however, for the last 10+ years I've built interesting stuff with electronics, code, 3dprinting to implement academic research projects 🏫 and gaming/music/artistic  🎮🎹🎨 installations which reimagine how we interact with data and technology.
 
😍 I've recently fallen in love with open source  (specially open source hardware) and  I'm eagerly learning 🌱 how to harness its power to tackle individual 👤 and community problems 🌍.  
Hence, I created [LibreTactile](https://github.com/LibreTactile) to apply my experience to the development of open source assistive technologies.  
I hope LibreTactile will create useful stuff for visually impaired users (and anyone interested in tactile hci, really), while connect with like-minded people and grow as a developer.
