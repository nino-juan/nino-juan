# Juan Nino

🎓 I'm a PhD student at Laval University in Canada. I have a background in mechatronics engineering 🦾🧑‍🛠️ (completed in Mexico). I started my carrer by tackling (manufacturing🏭) industry challenges, however, for the last 10+ years I've built interesting stuff using electronics, programming and 3dprinting. The stuff I build is generally used to implemented academic research projects 🏫 and gaming/music/artistic  🎮🎹🎨 installations which reimagine how we interact with data, technology, identity, community and disability.
 
😍 I've recently fallen in love with open source  (specially open source hardware) and  I'm eagerly learning 🌱 how to harness its power to tackle individual 👤 and community problems 🌍.  
Hence, I created [LibreTactile](https://github.com/LibreTactile) to apply my experience to the development of open source assistive technologies.  
I hope LibreTactile will create useful stuff for visually impaired users 🦯 (and anyone interested in tactile hci, really), while I connect with like-minded people and grow as a SW & HW developer and product manager.
