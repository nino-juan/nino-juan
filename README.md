# Juan Nino

🎓 I'm a Ph.D. student at Laval University in Canada with a background in mechatronics engineering 🦾🧑‍. For the last 10+ years, I've built interesting stuff using electronics, programming, and 3d printing. Generally, I implement (academic) [research-creation](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/programs-programmes/definitions-eng.aspx#:~:text=Research%2Dcreation%3A,%2C%20scholarly%20investigation%2C%20and%20experimentation.) projects 🏫 and gaming/music/artistic 🎮🎹🎨 installations which reimagine how we interact with data, technology, identity, community, and disability.
I've recently fallen in love with open source and I'm creating [LibreTactile](https://github.com/LibreTactile) to accelerate the development of open source assistive technologies.  
I hope LibreTactile will create useful stuff for visually impaired users 🦯, gamers 🎮, XR enthusiasts and anyone interested in tactile HCI.
